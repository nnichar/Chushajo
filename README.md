In this game, each player takes the role of a car driver who tries to outwit the competition. On your turn, you may rotate your car 90 degrees by press R then roll the dice by press enter and move it forward as return many spaces (2-8). If the car reaches the edge of the board, follow the curve and continue moving in the next row. The game ends when all players have played all roadways. Each gets 1 point per visible square. The player with most points wins!

## Requirements

1. Design and implement a GUI program. The program must open at least 2 frames or dialogs, JOptionPane not counted. Use javax.swing package for containers and components. JavaFX forms and components are not allowed.
 - The class that opens the first frame/dialog must be named MainApplication.
2. The following components must be included in any frame/dialog:
 - JTextField, JPasswordField, or JTextArea
 - JCheckBox or JRadioButton : at least 5 items
 - JComboBox or JList : at least 5 items
 - JButton : one frame/dialog must have a button that opens another frame/dialog
 - An extra component (child class of JComponent) not taught in class, e.g. JSpinner, JSlider, JTable
 - Names and IDs of everyone in your group, as any component
3. Implement at least 4 event handlers. The handlers are counted by method names.
 - In order to be counted, the handlers must do something substantially (not just printing/showing message). Out of the 4 handlers, one of them must be to handle KeyEvent and another one to handle MouseEvent. The other 2 handlers can be to handle any event.
